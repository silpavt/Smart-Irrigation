# Project Description
This project automates plant watering using an ESP32, a soil moisture sensor, a water level sensor, and a relay to control a pump. An OLED display is used to show real-time moisture and water level data.

# The Problem statement
Inefficient irrigation systems often lead to excessive water usage or inadequate watering, resulting in crop damage, resource wastage, and increased operational costs for farmers.
