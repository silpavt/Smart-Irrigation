## Project Description
The Smart Irrigation System is an IoT-based automated watering system designed to optimize water usage and reduce manual effort in farming and gardening. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, and water level sensor to monitor real-time environmental conditions. It automatically controls a water pump based on soil moisture levels, ensuring efficient water distribution.

With Blynk IoT integration, users can remotely monitor and control the system via a smartphone or web dashboard. The system also features an OLED display to show real-time values, providing both local and remote access to data. This project promotes smart agriculture by improving water efficiency and reducing labor costs

## The Problem statement
Inefficient irrigation systems often lead to excessive water usage or inadequate watering, resulting in crop damage, resource wastage, and increased operational costs for farmers. 

## The Solution
This system automates watering based on soil moisture levels while ensuring the water tank has enough water. It displays real-time data on an OLED screen and can also be monitored via Blynk.
